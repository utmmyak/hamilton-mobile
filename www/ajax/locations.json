By bringing the classroom into the museum, the Wellin functions as a \"teaching laboratory,\" available to students and faculty alike. The museum also serves the broader community, encouraging observation, exploration and engagement through its presentation of exhibitions on the cutting edge of art, art scholarship and research in other disciplines. The museum is named in honor of the parents of trustee Keith Wellin '50, who, along with his wife Wendy, provided funds for the College's new arts facilities.","link360":"https://www.google.com/maps/views/view/114750777888267481126/gphoto/5978883924715109730?gl=us&heading=224&pitch=86&fovy=75","linkStreetview":"https://www.google.com/maps/@43.0506832,-75.4092416,3a,75y,343.58h,81.93t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sj5c480BqlJRIzSnYYmqFYQ!2e0!6m1!1e1?hl=en-US","linkOther":"http://www.hamilton.edu/wellin","linkOtherText":"Wellin Museum of Art","imgpath":"/virtualTour/content/mobile/90/0.jpg"},{"id":"42","lat":"43.05146682774703","lng":"-75.40214044259682","name":"Wertimer House","description":"Wertimer House is located near the Bristol Center, Skenandoa House and Wallace Johnson House.
